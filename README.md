# Hey there!
This is a snake game made with the help of HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. I started this project just for fun and I'd like to make it better, efficient and add more features like support for mobile touch screen devices, responsiveness according to device screen size, full screen option, settings many more features as possible/needed. Thank-you!  : )

Note - 1) Font and sounds don't belong to me.
       2) Place all the folders in same directory along with SnakeGame.html in your PC.
