# Hey there!
This is a snake game made with the help of HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. I started this project just for fun and I'd like to make it better, add more features like support for touch screen devices, responsiveness on screen size change, full screen mode, settings and many more features as/if possible/needed. Thank-you!  : )

Controls-
Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys.. to turn the snake.
Press 'S' key for slow motion.
Press 'C' to change the color of the snake.
Press 'X' to turn ON/OFF auto color change feature.
Hit Space key to pause the game.
Press 'F' to display fps.
You can press '12311' alternately to make the snake go through canvas boudaries but this feature has bugs!
// Font and sounds don't belong to me.
