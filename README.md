# Hey there!
This is a snake game made with the help of HTML 5 canvas and JavaScript. I started this project just for fun and I'd like to make it better, efficient and add more features like support for touch screen mobile devices, responsiveness according to device screen size, full screen option, settings many more features as possible/needed. Thank-you!  : )
...
Controls-
Up, Down, Left, Right arrow keys.. to turn the snake.
Press 'S' key for slow motion.
Press 'C' to change the color of the snake.
Press 'X' to turn ON/OFF auto color change feature.
Hit Space key to pause the game.
Press 'F' to display fps.
You can press '12311' alternately to make the snake go through canvas boudaries but this feature has bugs!

Note - 1) Font and sounds don't belong to me.
       2) Place all the folders in same directory along with Snake Game.html in your PC.
