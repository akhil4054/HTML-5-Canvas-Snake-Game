This is a snake game made with the help of HTML 5 canvas, JavaScript. I started this project just for fun and I'd like to make it better, efficient and add more features like support for mobile touch screen devices, responsiveness according to device screen size, full screen option, settings many more features as possible/needed. Thank-you!  : )
